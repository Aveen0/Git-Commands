Git Commands for Beginners

What are Git Commands? And why do we need them?

Let’s start with very basic question. What is Git? Git is an open-source version control system. Basically, a version control system is used to help software teams to manage changes to the code. In simple words, we need git commands to operate GitHub.
Usually, this is more feasible when multiple people are working on a large-scale project. And since this a free for all system so it is called an open source. 

Here we will be discussing some of the basic git commands that every user needs to know. 
•	‘git branch’ command: This command is used to display all the names of the branches of your repository. 

•	‘git clone’ command: This command is used to copy an existing Git repository to the current repository.

•	‘git checkout’ command: This command is somewhat similar to the one above. Here you can not only create a new branch but also shift to it. Or you can simply just shift to another existing branch.

•	‘git clean’ command: This command is used to get rid of any untracked files. By untracked it means those files have been created but have not yet been added to the repository’s tracking index. 

•	‘git reset’ command: This command is used to undo changes in the current directory.

•	‘git add’ command: This command is used to add files to the staging area which is where the files which are going to be part of the next commit are kept which lets the git know about the next changes that are going to be in the next commit. 

•	‘git commit’ command: This command is used to save current changes to the local repository. However, it only saves the changes to the local repository and not the remote repository. 

•	‘git pull’ command: This command is used to download data from the remote repository and it also updates the local repository alongside. 

•	‘git push’ command: This command basically uploads the content from the local repository to the remote repository. Now all of the changes you have made are not only in your local repository but also your remote one. 

•	‘git merge’ command: This command is used to merge two branches together but for that they need to be conflict free. Basically, what it does is that takes the changes from the commit and merges them together with the current branch.
